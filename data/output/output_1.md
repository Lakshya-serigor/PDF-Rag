## Welcome to the Maryland 2024 Tax Year Booklet

Reflecting on the first two years of a four-year term, I am proud that our team has worked to modernize our agency and engage with Marylanders. We launched Maryland Tax Connect - a new and improved self-service portal for business tax filing and our agency’s first-ever report on the State of the Economy! This year’s rotation of covers highlights some of Maryland’s unique cultural institutions, showcasing our state’s museums that preserve its rich history and culture. While we couldn’t feature all the incredible museums to visit across Maryland, we proudly celebrate these three treasured institutions. Read below to learn more and send us your ideas on the attributes that make Maryland special that we should highlight in the coming years!

### The Washington County Museum of Fine Arts

Founded by Anna Brugh Singer and her husband William H. Singer, Jr. in Hagerstown, Maryland, the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts opened its doors in 1931 and expanded twice - in 1949 and 1994. The firm Hyde & Shepherd designed the building in the neo-Georgian style and features red brick construction trimmed with local limestone. The American Association of Museums accredited the museum in 1997 and it is the only art museum in Western Maryland to hold this honor. The museum’s collection has grown to include over 6,000 art objects.

### The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum

The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum was founded in 1965 as a project of the Historical Society of Talbot County, which obtained three waterfront houses along St. Michael Harbor. The museum was once a site for seafood packing houses, docks, and work boats, and it currently houses a wide range of exhibits, artifacts, and vessels from the Chesapeake Bay. The museum has interactive displays that showcase the Bay’s history and physical and economic environments. It makes for a great visit for adults and children alike!

### The Baltimore Museum of Industry

Founded in 1977, the Baltimore Museum of Industry (BMI) interprets the diverse and significant human stories behind labor and innovation in Baltimore, cultivating a sense of belonging and inspiring visitors to think critically about the intersection of work and society. Located in an 1860s oyster cannery on a five-acre waterfront campus, the BMI offers dynamic indoor and outdoor exhibitions, live demonstrations, tours, and hands-on activities for visitors of all ages. Current exhibitions explore the rise and fall of Bethlehem Steel at Sparrows Point, labor activism and unions in 21st century Baltimore, and the role of corner bars as social gathering spaces at the turn of the century.

The Francis Scott Key Bridge spanning Baltimore’s Patapsco River carried workers for nearly a half century—to steel mills, sugar refineries, and offices downtown. When it collapsed on March 26, 2024, it was being repaired by middle-of-the-night laborers filling potholes so Marylanders would have a safer ride to their jobs. In response, the museum has launched an oral history project to preserve the stories of people whose livelihoods have been impacted by the bridge collapse. The stories and materials collected will form the basis of public programs and a future long-term exhibition at the BMI about the Port, its history, and the jobs it sustains.

### A MESSAGE FROM THE COMPTROLLER

Dear Marylander,

Greetings! Thank you for taking the time to review our 2024 Maryland State Tax Forms and Instructions. We compile this publication each year to help guide Marylanders through the tax filing process and provide updates on tax code changes.

Our team at the Office of the Comptroller has been hard at work over the last year to begin an important revitalization in the agency. Guided by our agency-wide vision — to work in partnership to create a state that is more equitable, more resilient, and more prosperous so that every Marylander can reach their full potential — we set forth an ambitious agenda to modernize the agency and our infrastructure, obtain much-needed resources to better serve Marylanders throughout the state, and ensure Maryland is well-positioned for responsible long term economic growth and success.

The Comptroller’s Office released the agency's inaugural State of the Economy Report in January, using economic data from 2023. My team led this collaborative effort to better understand the forces at play that have led the state to receive less revenue in the past year. Future reports will dive into specific areas uncovered by our findings. You can find all our research reports at [marylandtaxes.gov/research](http://marylandtaxes.gov/research) to learn more.

As part of a much-needed modernization effort, we have launched Maryland Tax Connect, a self-service portal that now allows Maryland businesses to file their taxes online with increased ease and security, enabling taxpayers to interact with the Comptroller’s Office more efficiently. The portal is designed to allow taxpayers to complete essential functions and is accessible from a mobile device or a desktop. Our goal is for all Maryland taxpayers to be able to pay their state taxes and track their tax payments in this new system by 2026. For more information, visit [marylandtaxes.gov/MDTaxConnect](http://marylandtaxes.gov/MDTaxConnect).

Additionally, during the 2025 tax season, eligible Marylanders will be able to file their state and federal taxes for free through the new Direct File program. Direct File is a new, simple, and secure tax filing software developed by the IRS in partnership with the Comptroller of Maryland, which will allow eligible taxpayers to prepare and file their tax returns online, directly with the government. Visit [marylandtaxes.gov/directfile](http://marylandtaxes.gov/directfile) to learn more about this and other options available for Marylanders to file their taxes this year.

I am also pleased to report that we had another successful legislative session this past year. With broad stakeholder support, and in partnership with Governor Wes Moore, Senate President Bill Ferguson, and Speaker Adrienne Jones, we obtained additional resources for the Comptroller’s Office, including new positions to advance hiring efforts across the agency and $8.5 million for cybersecurity, training, audit efforts, equipment upgrades, maintenance, fraud, and accessibility-related projects, including translation services.

We also passed all six of our priority bills in our legislative package. Over the long term, these bills will help Marylanders by providing tax assistance funding for low-income residents of Maryland, supporting our agency’s compliance efforts, preventing and punishing tax preparer scams, promoting online filing, and providing resources to help raise awareness of personal income tax credits.

We look forward to working with you, your community, or your business. Only by building solid partnerships can we ensure the growth and thriving of our communities and businesses. Please call our team for assistance at 1-800-MD-TAXES or email us at taxhelp@marylandtaxes.gov.

Be well and please keep in touch!

My best,  
Brooke E. Lierman

# MARYLAND RESIDENT INCOME TAX 502 RETURN INSTRUCTIONS 2024

## DUE DATE

Your return is due by April 15, 2025. If you are a fiscal year taxpayer, see Instruction 25. If any due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return must be filed by the next business day. To speed up the processing of your tax refund, consider filing electronically. You must file within three years of the original due date to receive any refund. For more information, visit [marylandtaxes.gov](https://marylandtaxes.gov).

## COMPLETING THE RETURN

You must write legibly using blue or black ink when completing your return. To collect unpaid taxes, the Comptroller is authorized to seize the salary, wages, or property of delinquent taxpayers.

### WHO MUST FILE?

This booklet and forms are for residents and part-year residents of Maryland. In general, you must file a Maryland return if you are or were a resident of Maryland AND you are required to file a federal return. Information in this section will allow you to determine if you must file a return and pay taxes as a resident of Maryland. If you are not a resident but had Maryland tax withheld or had income from sources in Maryland, you must use Form 505 or 515, Nonresident Tax return.

DO NOT use pencil or red ink. Submit the original return, not a photocopy. If no entry is needed for a specific line, leave blank. Do not enter words such as “none” or “zero” and do not draw a line to indicate no entry. Failure to follow these instructions will delay the processing of your return. You may round off all cents to the nearest whole dollar. Fifty cents and above should be rounded to the next dollar. State calculations are rounded to the nearest cent.

### ELECTRONIC FILING INSTRUCTIONS

#### WHO IS A RESIDENT?

You are a resident of Maryland if:

a. Your permanent home is or was in Maryland (the law refers to this as your domicile). OR  
b. Your permanent home is outside of Maryland, but you maintained a place of abode (a place to live) in Maryland for more than six months of the tax year. If this applies to you and you were physically present in the state for 183 days or more, you must file a full-year resident return.

The instructions in this booklet are designed specifically for filers of paper returns.

#### PART-YEAR RESIDENTS

If you began or ended residence in Maryland during the tax year, you must file a Maryland resident income tax return. See Instruction 26.

Free internet filing is available for Maryland income tax returns. Visit [Maryland iFile](https://interactive.marylandtaxes.gov/Individuals/iFile_ChooseForm/).

Software vendors should refer to the e-file handbook for their instructions.

#### SUBSTITUTE FORMS

You may file your Maryland income tax return on a computer-prepared or computer-generated substitute form provided the form is approved in advance by the Revenue Administration Division. The fact that a software package is available for retail purchase does not guarantee that the package or all forms have been approved for use.

To confirm that a software package or a specific form has been approved by the Comptroller or to see a list of Approved Software Vendors for Maryland Substitute Forms, visit [marylandtaxes.gov](https://marylandtaxes.gov) and search Approved Vendors.

### PENALTIES

There are severe penalties for failing to file a tax return, failing to pay any tax when due, filing a false or fraudulent return, or making a false certification. Penalties may include civil fines, criminal fines, imprisonment, and a penalty on your taxes. In addition, interest is charged on amounts not paid.

### TO DETERMINE IF YOU ARE REQUIRED TO FILE A MARYLAND RETURN

a. Add up all of your federal gross income to determine your total federal income. Gross income is defined in the Internal Revenue Code and, in general, consists of all income regardless of source. It includes wages and other compensation for services, gross income derived from business, gains (not losses) derived from dealings in property, interest, rents, royalties, dividends, alimony, annuities, pensions, income from partnerships or fiduciaries, etc. If modifications or deductions reduce your gross income below the minimum filing level, you are still required to file. IRS Publication 525 provides additional information on taxable and nontaxable income.

b. Do not include Social Security or railroad retirement benefits in your total federal income.

c. Add to your total federal income any Maryland additions to income. Do not include any additions related to periods of nonresidence. See Instruction 12. This is your Maryland gross income.

d. If you are a dependent taxpayer, add to your total federal income any Maryland additions and subtract any Maryland subtractions. See Instructions 12 and 13. This is your Maryland gross income.

e. You must file a Maryland return if your Maryland gross income equals or exceeds the income levels in the MINIMUM FILING LEVEL TABLE 1.

f. If you or your spouse is 65 or over, use the MINIMUM FILING LEVEL TABLE 2.

g. You must also file a Maryland return if you have Maryland income tax liability resulting from credits you claimed in a previous year that are subject to recapture. (See Instruction for Line 21a.)

#### IF YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FILE A MARYLAND RETURN BUT HAD MARYLAND TAXES WITHHELD OR YOU QUALIFY TO CLAIM A REFUNDABLE CREDIT

To claim a refund for Maryland income taxes withheld or to claim a refundable credit (see Instruction 21), you must file a Maryland return. Taxpayers who are filing for refund only, should complete all of the information at the top of Form 502 and the following Lines:

- 1-16
- 22%, 29*
- 35-44
- 46, 48

*Enter a zero unless: (i) you claim an earned income credit on your federal return, or (ii) you do not meet the minimum age requirement under the federal credit, but are otherwise eligible for the federal credit, for those without a qualifying child.

Attach applicable withholding statements (Forms W-2 and 1099), Form 502CR, and Maryland Schedule K-1 (510/511). The total amount withheld on all Forms W-2 and 1099 must equal the withholding you are claiming. Complete direct deposit information (Instruction 22) if desired and sign the return.

### USE OF FEDERAL RETURN

First complete your 2024 federal income tax return. You will need information from your federal return to complete your Maryland return. Complete your federal return before you continue. Maryland law requires that your income and deductions be entered on your Maryland return exactly as they were reported on your federal return. If you use federal Form 1040NR, visit [marylandtaxes.gov](https://marylandtaxes.gov) for further information. All items reported on your Maryland return are subject to verification, audit, and revision by the Maryland State Comptroller’s Office.

### MARYLAND HEALTHCARE COVERAGE

The Maryland General Assembly enacted Chapter 423 in the 2019 Session requiring the collection of certain information, including whether an individual is uninsured at the time the tax return is filed and whether the individual is interested in having Maryland Health Connection (“MHC”) determine whether an individual may be eligible for insurance affordability programs, such as no-cost or low-cost minimum essential health care coverage.

Check the appropriate box on Form 502 for you and/or your spouse if you are uninsured as of the date you file your return. If you would like MHC to determine pre-eligibility for health insurance affordability programs for any uninsured member of your household, you must also check the box on Form 502 indicating you authorize the Comptroller to share information from your tax return with MHC, which is operated by the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange.

For each dependent identified on Form 502B, check the appropriate box to indicate if that dependent is an uninsured individual as of the date the return is filed. You must provide the date of birth for any uninsured individual who is interested in obtaining minimum essential health coverage.

If you authorize information sharing, we will share the following information with MHC:

- Name, SSN/ITIN, and date of birth of each individual identified on your return;
- Your current mailing address, email address, and phone number;
- Filing status reported on your return;
- Total number of individuals in your household included in your return;
- Insured/uninsured status of each individual included in your return;
- Blindness status;
- Relationship (self, spouse, or dependent) to the primary taxpayer for each individual included in your return; and
- Your federal adjusted gross income amount from Line 1.

Information shared with MHC will be used to determine eligibility for insurance affordability programs or to assist with enrollment in health coverage. If you would like more information about the health insurance affordability programs or health care coverage enrollment, visit Maryland Health Connection at [marylandhealthconnection.gov/easyenrollment/](https://marylandhealthconnection.gov/easyenrollment/).

### NAME AND ADDRESS

Print using blue or black ink. Enter your name exactly as entered on your federal tax return. If you changed your name because of marriage, divorce, etc., be sure to report the change to the Social Security Administration before filing your return. This will prevent delays in the processing of your return.

Enter your current address using the spaces provided. On Current Mailing Address Line 1, enter the street number and street name of your current address. If using a PO Box address, enter “PO Box” and the PO Box number on Current Mailing Address Line 1. On Current Mailing Address Line 2, if applicable, enter the floor, suite or apartment number for your current mailing address. If using a PO Box address, leave Current Mailing Address Line 2 blank. Enter City or Town, State, and ZIP Code + 4.

If using a foreign address, complete the lines indicated for Country Name, Province/State/County, and Postal Code.

### SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER(S) (SSN)

It is important that you enter each digit of your Social Security number in the space provided at the top of your tax return. Missing or unreadable digits will delay the processing of your return. Your name must match the name on your current Social Security card to ensure you receive your personal exemption. If your name does not match the name on your Social Security card, contact the federal Social Security Administration at 800-722-1213, or visit [ssa.gov](https://ssa.gov).

The Social Security number(s) must be a valid number issued by the Social Security Administration of the United States Government. If you, your spouse, or dependent(s) do not have a Social Security number and you are not eligible to get a SSN, you must apply for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) with the IRS and you should wait until you have received it before you file; and enter it wherever your Social Security number is requested on the return.

A missing or incorrect SSN or ITIN could result in the disallowance of any credits or exemptions you may be entitled to and result in a balance due.

A valid SSN or ITIN is required for any claim or exemption for a dependent. If you have a dependent who was placed with you for legal adoption and you do not know their SSN, you must get an Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number (ATIN) for the dependent from the IRS.

If your child was born and died in this tax year and you do not have a SSN for the child, complete just the name and relationship of the dependent and enter code 322, on one of the code number lines located to the right of the telephone number area on page 4 of the form; attach a copy of the child’s death certificate to your return.

### MARYLAND POLITICAL SUBDIVISION INFORMATION (REQUIRED)

Fill in the lines for your Maryland physical address of the taxing area as of December 31, 2024, including political subdivision lines, based on your residence on the last day of the taxable period. Part-year residents fill in the lines for your Maryland physical address, including political subdivision lines, based on your last day of residence in Maryland in the taxable period. Military personnel who are legal residents of Maryland should fill in the lines for your Maryland physical address, including political subdivision lines, based on the Maryland physical address that is used for claiming Maryland as your Home of Record on file with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for tax year 2024.

1. Find your 4-Digit Political Subdivision Code in the LIST OF INCORPORATED CITIES, TOWNS, AND TAXING AREAS IN MARYLAND and enter this number on the 4 DIGIT POLITICAL SUBDIVISION CODE line.

When selecting the 4 Digit Political Subdivision Code, be sure that you have selected the proper political subdivision from the LIST OF INCORPORATED CITIES, TOWNS AND TAXING AREAS IN MARYLAND. Do not rely on your ZIP Code + 4 to identify the proper political subdivision. For example, most residents within the ZIP Code of Upper Marlboro do not reside in the political subdivision of the Town of Upper Marlboro. Therefore, entering the Town of Upper Marlboro on the 4 DIGIT POLITICAL SUBDIVISION CODE line for those with a ZIP Code in Upper Marlboro may not be correct. Also, some political subdivisions have similar names such as Bel Air in Allegany County and Town of Bel Air in Harford County or Town of Chevy Chase and Town of Chevy Chase View. You may contact your county seat for further information relating to the incorporated boundaries of incorporated cities, towns, and taxing areas in your county.

If you itemized your deductions on the joint federal return, one spouse may use the standard deduction and the other spouse may claim those deductions on the federal return that are “attributable exclusively” to that spouse, plus a prorated amount of the remaining deductions. If it is not possible to determine these deductions, the deduction must be allocated proportionately based on your share of the income.

“Attributable exclusively” means that the individual is solely responsible for the payment of an expense claimed as an itemized deduction, including compliance with a valid court order or separation agreement; or the individual jointly responsible for the payment of an expense claimed as an itemized deduction can demonstrate payment of the full amount of the deduction with funds that are not attributable in whole or in part, to the other jointly responsible individual.

If both spouses choose to itemize on their separate Maryland returns, then each spouse must determine which deductions are attributable exclusively to each spouse and prorate the remaining deductions using the Maryland Income Factor. See Instruction 26k. If it is not possible to determine deductions in this manner, they must be allocated proportionately based on their respective shares of the income. The total amount of itemized deductions for both spouses cannot exceed the itemized deductions on the federal return.

If you choose to use the standard deduction method, use STANDARD DEDUCTION WORKSHEET (16A) in Instruction 16. Each spouse must claim their own personal exemption. Each spouse may allocate the dependent exemptions in any manner they choose. A dependent may not be claimed twice. The total number of dependents claimed may not exceed the overall number of dependents.

Complete the remainder of the form using the instructions for each line. Each spouse should claim their own withholding and other credits. Joint estimated tax paid may be divided between the spouses in any manner provided the total claimed does not exceed the total estimated tax paid.

### PART-YEAR RESIDENTS

If you began or ended legal residence in Maryland in 2024 see Instruction 26.

Military taxpayers: If you have non-Maryland military income, see Technical Bulletin 1.

### EXEMPTIONS

Determine what exemptions you are entitled to and complete the EXEMPTIONS area on Form 502. Form 502B must be completed and attached to Form 502 if you are claiming one or more dependents.

#### EXEMPTIONS ALLOWED

You are entitled to claim qualified exemptions on your Maryland return. The amount of your Maryland exemption may be limited by the amount of your federal adjusted gross income. See Exemption Amount Chart (10A).

You and your spouse are permitted to claim additional exemptions if, on the last day of the taxable year, you or your spouse is age 65 or older or blind. These additional exemptions are in the amount of $1,000 each. An individual who turns 65 or becomes blind after the last day of the taxable year, but before they file their return, does not qualify for the additional exemption. If any other dependent claimed is 65 or over, you also receive an additional exemption of up to $3,200. Make sure you check both boxes (4) and (5) of Form 502B for each of your dependents who are age 65 or over. You must provide the date(s) of birth for all individuals listed on the 502B.

Enter the number of exemptions in the appropriate boxes based upon your entries in Parts A, B and C of the exemption area of the form. Enter the total number of exemptions in Part D. The number of exemptions for Part C is from Total Dependent Exemptions, Line 3 of Form 502B.

You may also be entitled to credits for these taxable expenses. See instructions for Part B and Part CC of Form 502CR.
- **Line 10a. PENSION EXCLUSION.** You may be able to subtract some of your taxable pension and retirement annuity income. This subtraction applies only if:
  - a. You were 65 or over or totally disabled, or your spouse was totally disabled, on the last day of the tax year, AND
  - b. You included on your federal return taxable income received as a pension, annuity, or endowment from an “employee retirement system” qualified under Sections 401(a), 403 or 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. [A traditional IRA, a Roth IRA, a rollover IRA, a simplified employee plan (SEP), a Keogh plan, an ineligible deferred compensation plan or foreign retirement income does not qualify.]

Note: For additional information regarding qualified plans pension exclusion, refer to FAQs #2 on page iii Resident Booklet; and Form 502R Instructions; and the chart of Form 502R.

Each spouse who receives taxable pension or annuity income and is 65 or over or totally disabled may be entitled to this exclusion. In addition, if you receive taxable pension or annuity income but you are not 65 or totally disabled, you may be entitled to this exclusion if your spouse is totally disabled. Complete a separate column in the PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTATION WORKSHEET (13A) for each spouse. Combine your allowable exclusion and enter the total amount on Line 10a, Form 502. On Line 10a, Form 502 check the applicable box(es) for yourself and/or spouse.

To be considered totally disabled, you must have a mental or physical impairment which prevents you from engaging in substantial gainful activity. You must expect the impairment to be of long, continued, or indefinite duration or to result in your death. You must attach to your return a certification from a qualified physician stating the nature of your impairment and that you are totally disabled. If you have previously submitted a physician's certification, attach your own statement that you are still totally disabled and that a physician's certification was submitted before.

If you are a part-year resident, complete PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTATION WORKSHEET (13A) using total taxable pension and total Social Security and railroad retirement benefits as if you were a full-year resident. Prorate the amount on Line 5 by the number of months of Maryland residence divided by 12. However, if you began to receive your pension during the tax year you became a Maryland resident, use a proration factor of the number of months you were a resident divided by the number of months the pension was received.

For example, Pat Taxpayer moved to Maryland on March 1. If he started to receive his pension on March 1, he would prorate the pension exclusion by 10/10, which would mean he would be entitled to the full pension exclusion. However, if he began to receive his pension on February 1, Pat would prorate his pension by 10/11. Note that, in any case, the proration factor may not

tive as certified by the Maryland Department of Agriculture. Attach a copy of the certification.

**Example:**

Pat and Chris Jones had a federal adjusted gross income of $180,000. They also had $40,000 on interest from U.S. Savings Bonds and had a dependent son whom they claimed on the Maryland tax return. Using Instruction 10, they found the exemption amount on their Maryland return (based upon $180,000 of income) was $2,400 ($800 for three exemptions). If it were not for the $40,000 of U.S. Savings Bonds, their federal adjusted gross income would have been $140,000 and their exemption amount would have been $9,600 ($3,200 for three exemptions). Therefore, Pat and Chris Jones are entitled to claim a subtraction of $7,200 ($9,600 - $2,400) on Line hh of Form 502SU.

The amount on Line 8 of Form 502LU is added to Line 15 Total subtractions.

### ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS

If you figure your tax by the ITEMIZED DEDUCTION METHOD, complete Lines 17a and b on Form 502. (See Instruction 16 to see if you will use the ITEMIZED DEDUCTION METHOD.)

Copy the amount from federal Form 1040, Schedule A, Line 17, Total Itemized Deductions, on Line 17a of Form 502. Certain items of federal itemized deductions are not eligible for State purposes and must be subtracted from Line 17a. State and local income taxes used as a deduction for federal purposes must be entered on Line 17b (there are certain limitations on the deduction amount of state and local tax. For more information, visit marylandtaxes.gov). Also, any amounts deducted as contributions of Preservation or Conservation Easements for which a credit is claimed must be added to Line 17b.

### FIGURE YOUR MARYLAND ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME

Complete Lines 1-16 on Form 502. Line 16 is your Maryland adjusted gross income.

### FIGURE YOUR MARYLAND TAXABLE NET INCOME

To find your taxable income you must subtract either the standard deduction from the worksheet or the itemized deductions you have entered on Line 17 of Form 502. The ITEMIZED DEDUCTION METHOD will lower your taxes if you have enough deductions. If you are not certain about which method to use, figure your tax both ways to determine which method is best for you. Check one of the deduction method boxes to indicate which method you will use.

#### STANDARD DEDUCTION METHOD

The STANDARD DEDUCTION METHOD gives you a standard deduction of 15% of Maryland adjusted gross income (Line 16) with minimums of $1,800 and $3,650 and maximums of $2,700 and $5,450, depending on your filing status. Use STANDARD DEDUCTION WORKSHEET (16A) for your filing status to figure your standard deduction. Write the result on Line 17 of Form 502. Then follow the instructions for EXEMPTIONS.

#### ITEMIZED DEDUCTION METHOD

You may itemize your deductions only if you itemized deductions on your federal return. See Instruction 14 for completing Lines 17a and b of Form 502. Enter the result on Line 17. You are not required to itemize deductions on your Maryland return simply because you itemized on your federal return. Figure your tax each way to determine which method is best for you.

### EXEMPTIONS

After completing the EXEMPTIONS area on your return (page 2), enter the total exemption amount on Line 19 of Form 502.

### PART-YEAR RESIDENTS AND NONRESIDENT MILITARY TAXPAYERS

You must adjust your standard or itemized deductions and exemptions. If you are a part-year resident, see Instruction 26. If you are a nonresident military member filing a joint return with your civilian spouse, see Technical Bulletin 1.

### FIGURE YOUR MARYLAND TAX

You must use the tax tables if your taxable income is less than $100,000.

The 2024 Maryland tax rate schedules are shown so you can see the tax rate that applies to all levels of income; however, do not use them to figure your tax. Instead, use the tax tables if your income is under $100,000; otherwise, use the appropriate row in the MARYLAND TAX COMPUTATION WORKSHEET SCHEDULES (17A) at the end of the tax tables to figure your tax. The tax tables and the MARYLAND TAX COMPUTATION WORKSHEET SCHEDULES I AND II have been based on these tax rate schedules.

Find the income range in the tax table that applies to the amount on Line 20 of Form 502. Find the Maryland tax corresponding to your income range. Enter the tax amount on Line 21 of Form 502. If your taxable income is $100,000 or more, use the MARYLAND TAX COMPUTATION WORKSHEET SCHEDULES (17A) at the end of the tax table.

If you claimed an earned income credit on your federal return or would otherwise have been eligible to claim an earned income credit on your federal return but for you or your spouse filing with an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), you are eligible for the Maryland earned income credit. If you are a married couple filing either a joint or separate Maryland return, or you have at least one qualifying child, then you may claim one-half (50%) of the federal credit on your Maryland return. Individuals filing as single, head of household, or qualifying surviving spouse without a qualifying child may claim 100% of the federal earned income credit, see Worksheet (18A.1) to calculate any refundable earned income tax credit. If you are a part-year resident or a member of the military, see Instruction 26(0) before completing this worksheet. If you do not meet the minimum age requirement under the federal credit and are otherwise eligible for the federal credit for those without a qualifying child, you may claim the state earned income credit (calculate federal earned income credit disregarding the minimum age requirement). If you or your spouse do not possess a valid SSN but are otherwise eligible for the federal credit and are filing your Maryland return using an ITIN, you may claim the state earned income credit by calculating the federal earned income credit disregarding the SSN requirement. If you filed a joint federal return but a separate Maryland return, you may claim a combined total of up to one-half the federal credit. For information on how to calculate the amount of the federal earned income credit, visit irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p596.pdf.

If you request direct deposit on your electronic return, your refund should be in your bank account within 72 hours of acknowledgment from the Revenue Administration Division. You may request electronic funds withdrawal (direct debit) payments on your electronic return. If you both file and pay electronically, your return is due April 15th. If any due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the return must be filed by the next business day. However, you will have until April 30th to make your electronic payment. Note: An online payment where the bank mails the Comptroller of Maryland a paper check is not considered an electronic payment. You may file your return electronically through your personal computer. Do not send a paper copy of the return if you electronically filed. For more information, visit marylandtaxes.gov.

#### Electronic Payment of Balance Due

If your paper or electronic tax return has a balance due, you may pay electronically at marylandtaxes.gov by selecting Bill Pay. The amount that you designate will be debited from your bank or financial institution on the date that you choose.

#### Payment by Check or Money Order

Make your check or money order payable to “Comptroller of Maryland.” You must use blue or black ink. Do not use red ink or pencil. Write the type of tax and year of tax being paid on your check. You must include the Social Security number/Individual Taxpayer Identification Number of the taxpayer if filing individually; if filing jointly, you must include the Social Security number/Individual Taxpayer Identification Number if the primary taxpayer on the check.

To file a fiscal year return, complete the fiscal year information at the top of Form 502, and print “FY” in bold letters in the upper left-hand corner of the form.

Your return must show all income reported on your federal return, regardless of when or where earned. However, you are permitted to subtract income received when not a resident of Maryland. The following instructions describe the adjustments which must be made for a part-year resident return and returns filed by certain military taxpayers (see Instruction 29) and married couples who file a joint return when one spouse is not a resident of Maryland.

a. You must file Form 502.

b. Whenever the term “tax year” is used in these instructions, it means that portion of the year in which you were a resident of Maryland. If you began residence in Maryland in 2024, the last day of the “tax year” was December 31, 2024. If you ended residence in Maryland in 2024, the last day of the “tax year” was the day before you established residence in another state.

c. Complete the name and address information at the top of Form 502. On Current Mailing Address Line 1, enter the street number and street name of your current address. If using a PO Box address, enter “PO Box” and the PO Box number on Current Mailing Address Line 1. On Current Mailing Address Line 2, if applicable enter the floor, suite, or apartment number for your current mailing address. If using a PO Box address, leave Current Mailing Address Line 2 blank.

d. Complete the Maryland political subdivision information using Instruction 6. The Maryland political subdivision information includes the 4 DIGIT POLITICAL SUBDIVISION CODE, MARYLAND POLITICAL SUBDIVISION, MARYLAND PHYSICAL ADDRESS LINE 1, MARYLAND PHYSICAL ADDRESS LINE 2, CITY, ZIP CODE + 4, and MARYLAND COUNTY fields. Use the county, city, town, or taxing area of which you were a resident on the last day of your Maryland residence.

e. Complete the filing status area using the same filing status that you used on your federal return. Married couples who file joint federal returns may file separate Maryland returns under certain circumstances. See Instruction 7. If you are a dependent taxpayer, use filing status 6.

f. Complete the EXEMPTIONS area. Additional exemptions are allowed for age and blindness for Maryland purposes which will be computed in this area.

g. Complete the Part-year/MILITARY area on the front of Form 502. Place a “P” in the box and show the dates of residence in Maryland. Certain military taxpayers following these instructions should place an “M” in the box and enter the non-Maryland military income. If you are both part-year and military, place a “P” and “M” in the box. Married taxpayers with different tax periods filing a joint Maryland return should enter a “D” in the box, follow the remainder of this instruction and write “different tax periods” in the dates of residence area. Married taxpayers who file a joint return when one spouse is not a resident of Maryland should place a “P” in the part year resident box and enter the name and the other state of residence of the nonresident spouse.

h. Enter on Line 1 the adjusted gross income from your federal return for the entire year regardless of your length of residence.

i. Complete the ADDITIONS TO INCOME area using Instruction 12. If you had losses or adjustments to income on your federal return, write on Line 5 those loss or adjustment items that were realized or paid when you were not a resident of Maryland.

j. Complete the SUBTRACTIONS FROM INCOME area using Instruction 13. You may include only subtractions from income that apply to income subject to Maryland tax. Include on Line 12 any income received during the part of the year when you were not a resident of Maryland.

k. You must adjust your standard or itemized deductions and exemptions based on the percentage of your income subject to Maryland tax. Complete the MARYLAND INCOME FACTOR WORKSHEET (26A) to figure the percentage of Maryland income to total income.

l. If you itemize deductions, complete Lines 17a and b. Prorate the itemized deductions using the following formula:

   ```
   NET MARYLAND ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS x MARYLAND INCOME FACTOR = MARYLAND ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS
   ```

   Enter the prorated amount on Line 17 of Form 502 and check the ITEMIZED DEDUCTION METHOD box. Another method of allocating itemized deductions may be allowed. Send your written request along with your completed Maryland return, a copy of your federal return including federal Schedule A and a copy of the other state’s return. If the other state does not have an income tax, then submit a schedule showing the allocation of income and itemized deductions among the states. The Maryland return must be completed in accordance with the alternative method requested. This request should be sent to the Revenue Administration Division, Taxpayer Accounting Section (Special Allocations), P.O. Box 1829, Annapolis, MD 21404-1829.

m. If you are not itemizing deductions, you must use the standard deduction. The standard deduction must be prorated using the Maryland income factor. Calculate the standard deduction using a worksheet in Instruction 16. Prorate the standard deduction using the following formula:

   ```
   MARYLAND PRORATED STANDARD DEDUCTION x MARYLAND INCOME FACTOR = STANDARD DEDUCTION
   ```

   Enter the prorated amount on Line 17 of Form 502 and check the STANDARD DEDUCTION METHOD box.

n. The value of your exemptions (Line 19) must be prorated using the Maryland income factor. Prorate the exemption amount using the following formula:

   ```
   TOTAL EXEMPTION AMOUNT x MARYLAND INCOME FACTOR = PRORATED EXEMPTION AMOUNT
   ```

   Enter the prorated exemption amount on Line 19 of Form 502.

o. You must prorate your earned income, poverty level, and refundable earned income credits using the Maryland income factor.

#### Maryland Income Factor Worksheet (26A)

1. Enter amount from Line 16 of Form 502... .$
2. Enter amount from Line 1 of Form 502 ....$
3. Divide Line 1 above by Line 2. Carry this amount to six decimal places. The factor cannot exceed 1 (100%) and cannot be less than zero (0%). If Line 1 is 0 or less, the factor is 0. If Line 1 is greater than 0 and Line 2 is 0 or less, the factor is 1.

#### Earned Income Credit

Multiply your federal earned income credit by the Maryland income factor from Line 3 of the MARYLAND INCOME FACTOR WORKSHEET (26A). Enter the result as the federal earned income credit amount on Line 2 of the STATE EARNED INCOME CREDIT WORKSHEET (18A) in Instruction 18 and on Line 1 of the LOCAL EARNED INCOME CREDIT WORKSHEET (19B) in Instruction 19.

Multiply the amount from Line 5 of the STATE POVERTY LEVEL CREDIT WORKSHEET (18B) in Instruction 18 by the Maryland income factor and enter this amount as the credit on Line 23 of Form 502. Multiply the amount from Line c of the LOCAL POVERTY LEVEL CREDIT WORKSHEET (19C) in Instruction 19 by the Maryland income factor and enter this amount as the credit on Line 30 of Form 502.

## PAYMENT VOUCHER WORKSHEET FOR ESTIMATED TAX AND EXTENSION PAYMENTS (PVW)

### ESTIMATED TAX WORKSHEET INSTRUCTIONS

**Purpose of declaration.** The filing of a declaration of estimated Maryland income tax is a part of the pay-as-you-go plan of income tax collection adopted by the State. If you have any income such as pensions, business income, lottery, capital gains, interest, dividends, etc., from which no tax is withheld, or wages from which not enough Maryland tax is withheld, you may have to pay estimated taxes. The law is similar to the federal law.

- **If Filing Status 2, 4, 5:** If the amount computed is less than $3,650, enter $3,650; if the amount is between $3,650 and $5,450, enter that amount; if the amount is more than $5,450, enter $5,450.
- **Itemized deductions.** Enter the total of federal itemized deductions less state and local income taxes.
- **Line 6. Personal exemptions.** If your FAGI will be $100,000 or less, you are allowed:
  - a. $3,200 each for taxpayer and spouse.
  - b. $1,000 each for taxpayer and spouse if age 65 or over and/or blind.
  - c. $3,200 for each allowable dependent, other than taxpayer and spouse. The amount is doubled for allowable dependents age 65 or over.

If your FAGI will be more than $100,000, see chart below to determine the amount of exemption you can claim for items a and c above.

**Who must file a declaration.** You must file a declaration of estimated tax if you are required to file a Maryland income tax return and your gross income would be expected to develop a tax of more than $500 in excess of your Maryland withholding.

You must file a declaration with payment in full within 60 days of receiving $500 or more of income from awards, prizes, lotteries or raffles, whether paid in cash or property if Maryland tax has not been withheld. A married couple may file a joint declaration. If you are filing a joint declaration, both Social Security numbers must be entered. If filing on behalf of a minor, the name and Social Security number of the minor must be entered.

**When to file a declaration.** You must pay at least one-fourth of the total estimated tax on Line 15 of this form on or before April 15, 2025. The remaining quarterly payments are due June 15, 2025, September 15, 2025, and January 15, 2026. You may pay the total estimated tax with your first payment. If you are filing on a fiscal year basis, each payment is due by the 15th day of the 4th, 6th, 9th, and 13th months following the beginning of the fiscal year.

**Overpayment of tax.** If you overpaid your 2024 income tax (Form 502 or 505), you may apply all or part of the overpayment to your 2025 estimated tax. If the overpayment applied equals or exceeds the estimated tax liability for the first quarterly payment, you are not required to file the declaration. If the overpayment applied is less than the estimated tax liability, you should file the declaration and pay the balance of the first installment.

**How to estimate your 2025 tax.** The worksheet is designed to develop an estimate of your 2025 Maryland and local income tax. Be as accurate as you can in forecasting your 2025 income. You may use your 2024 income tax as a guide, but if you will receive more income than you did in 2024, you must pay at least 110% of your prior year tax to avoid interest for underpayment of estimated tax. For the purpose of estimating, rounding all amounts to the nearest dollar is recommended.

| If Your federal AGI is | Each Spouse Exemption is | Each Exemption is |
|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| $100,000 or less       | $3,200                   | $3,200            |
| over $100,000          | $1,600                   | $3,200            |
| $125,000               | $800                     | $3,200            |
| $150,000               | $0                       | $1,600            |
| $175,000               | $0                       | $800              |
| In excess of $200,000  | $0                       | $0                |

Nonresidents who want to estimate 2025 Maryland taxes may use the Nonresident Estimate Tax Calculator at marylandtaxes.gov.

**Line 8. Maryland income tax.** Use the tax rate schedules below to compute your tax on the amount on Line 7.

### Specific Instructions

You may subtract certain items from federal adjusted gross income. See Instruction 13 of the tax instructions. Enter on this line the net result of additions and subtractions.
- **Line 4.** Deductions. You may compute your tax using the standard deduction method or the itemized deduction method.
  - **Standard deduction.** Compute 15% of Line 3.
  - **If Filing Status 1, 3, 6:** If the amount computed is less than $1,800, enter $1,800; if the amount is between $1,800 and $2,700, enter that amount; if the amount is more than $2,700, enter $2,700.

You must include the Social Security number/Individual Taxpayer Identification Number of the taxpayer if filing individually, if filing jointly, you must include the Social Security number/Individual Taxpayer Identification Number of the primary taxpayer on the check or money order. Failure to include this information will delay the processing of your payment. DO NOT SEND CASH.

**File and pay your estimated tax online.** Scan the above QR code with your mobile phone or tablet’s QR Reader. Free readers are available at your favorite APP store.

### EXTENSION WORKSHEET INSTRUCTIONS

**Who must file for an extension?**  
If you cannot complete and file your Form 502, 505, 510C, or 515 by the due date, you should complete the Tax Payment Worksheet to determine if you must file for an extension. If Line 6 of the worksheet shows you owe tax, you must file Form PV and pay the full amount due by April 15, 2025, (or the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of the tax year). If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return must be filed by the next business day.

If you owe any tax, file Form PV along with your payment on or before April 15, 2025. If you are filing on a fiscal year basis, file by the regular due date of your return. If any due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return and payment must be filed by the next business day.

**How to file:**  
For an extension request with payment, use electronic funds withdrawal (direct debit) from savings or checking account, or to make payment(s) by credit card, visit marylandtaxes.gov; otherwise, make check or money order payable to: COMPTROLLER OF MARYLAND.

For returns filed with payments, attach check or money order to Form PV. Make check or money order payable to Comptroller of Maryland. On your check or money order, you must include the Social Security number/Individual Taxpayer Identification Number of the taxpayer if filing individually. If filing jointly, you must include the Social Security number/Individual Taxpayer Identification Number of the primary taxpayer, tax type, and tax year on the check/money order. Failure to include this information will delay the processing of your payment.

Mail to:  
Payment Processing  
PO Box 8888  
Annapolis, MD 21401-8888

**Will penalties and interest be owed?**  
NOTE: Filing an extension does not extend the time for paying your taxes. Do not file for an extension if, after completing the PVW, you find that you do not owe additional tax. However, be aware that if an unpaid liability is disclosed when you file your return, you may owe penalty and interest charges in addition to the tax. See “Will penalties and interest be owed?”.

You will owe interest on tax not paid by the regular due date of your return. The interest will accrue until you pay the tax. Even if you had a good reason for not paying on time, you will still owe interest. If tax and interest are not paid promptly, a penalty will be assessed on the tax.

**When should I include a copy of Form PV if I am requesting an extension of time to file?**

**Automatic Maryland six-month extension**  
If you filed a federal extension and expect to owe zero tax to Maryland we grant you an automatic six-month extension of time to file your Form 502, 505, 510C, or 515. You are not required to file for an extension in order to obtain this automatic extension. However, you should use Form PV to pay any tax due of forms 502, 505, and 515, but you should use Form EL102B to pay any tax due or payment with extension of Form 510C in order to avoid any late-payment penalty and interest on tax not paid by April 15, 2025.

Note: In the case of Form 510C, the PVW must be completed to estimate the payment.

Only include Form PV with Form 502, 505, or 515 if you are filing an extension request along with a payment by check or money order. If you are making an extension payment electronically, you do not need to include Form PV. Do not include Form PV to request an extension if you are not making an extension payment.

# State Department of Assessments and Taxation Information Regarding Property Tax Credits and Exemptions

Under Maryland law, you may be eligible for a substantial credit on the property tax bill issued on your home, based upon your gross household income. This program is available to homeowners of all ages and the credit is calculated solely on the basis of gross income. The application form is not provided in this income tax booklet because the credits are issued as a deduction from the homeowner’s July property tax bill. The property tax credit application forms are processed separately by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation.

Use the chart printed below to see if it would be worthwhile for you to submit a Homeowners’ Tax Credit application. If the actual property taxes on your home (based on no more than $300,000 of assessed value) exceed the “Tax Limit” amount shown on the table below for your household income level, you may be eligible for a credit and are urged to file an application. The table is printed for illustrative purposes, and therefore, the income amounts are listed in increments of $1,000. For purposes of this program, the applicant must report total income, which means the combined gross household income before any deductions are taken. Nontaxable income, such as Social Security, Railroad Retirement, or Veterans’ benefits, also must be reported as income for the tax credit program.

| Combined Gross Household Income | Tax Limit |
|---------------------------------|-----------|
| $0 - $8,000                     | $0        |
| $9,000                          | $40       |

* For each additional $1,000 of Income add $90 to $1,680 to find the amount that your tax must exceed.
