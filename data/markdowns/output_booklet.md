## Welcome to the Maryland 2024 Tax Year Booklet

Reflecting on the first two years of a four-year term, I am proud that our team has worked to modernize our agency and engage with Marylanders. We launched Maryland Tax Connect – a new and improved self-service portal for business tax filing and our agency’s first-ever report on the State of the Economy! This year’s rotation of covers highlights some of Maryland’s unique cultural institutions, showcasing our state’s museums that preserve its rich history and culture.

While we couldn’t feature all the incredible museums to visit across Maryland, we proudly celebrate these three treasured institutions. Read below to learn more and send us your ideas on the attributes that make Maryland special that we should highlight in the coming years!

### The Washington County Museum of Fine Arts

Founded by Anna Brugh Singer and her husband William H. Singer, Jr. in Hagerstown, Maryland, the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts opened its doors in 1931 and expanded twice - in 1949 and 1994. The firm Hyde & Shepherd designed the building in the neo-Georgian style and features red brick construction trimmed with local limestone. The American Association of Museums accredited the museum in 1997 and it is the only art museum in Western Maryland to hold this honor. The museum’s collection has grown to include over 6,000 art objects.

### The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum

The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum was founded in 1965 as a project of the Historical Society of Talbot County, which obtained three waterfront houses along St. Michael Harbor. The museum was once a site for seafood packing houses, docks, and work boats, and it currently houses a wide range of exhibits, artifacts, and vessels from the Chesapeake Bay. The museum has interactive displays that showcase the Bay’s history and physical and economic environments. It makes for a great visit for adults and children alike!

### The Baltimore Museum of Industry

Founded in 1977, the Baltimore Museum of Industry (BMI) interprets the diverse and significant human stories behind labor and innovation in Baltimore, cultivating a sense of belonging and inspiring visitors to think critically about the intersection of work and society. Located in an 1860s oyster cannery on a five-acre waterfront campus, the BMI offers dynamic indoor and outdoor exhibitions, live demonstrations, tours, and hands-on activities for visitors of all ages. Current exhibitions explore the rise and fall of Bethlehem Steel at Sparrows Point, labor activism and unions in 21st century Baltimore, and the role of corner bars as social gathering spaces at the turn of the century.

The Francis Scott Key Bridge spanning Baltimore’s Patapsco River carried workers for nearly a half century—to steel mills, sugar refineries, and offices downtown. When it collapsed on March 26, 2024, it was being repaired by middle-of-the-night laborers filling potholes so Marylanders would have a safer ride to their jobs. In response, the museum has launched an oral history project to preserve the stories of people whose livelihoods have been impacted by the bridge collapse. The stories and materials collected will form the basis of public programs and a future long-term exhibition at the BMI about the Port, its history, and the jobs it sustains.

A Message from the Comptroller

Dear Marylander,

Greetings! Thank you for taking the time to review our 2024 Maryland State Tax Forms and Instructions. We compile this publication each year to help guide Marylanders through the tax filing process and provide updates on tax code changes.

Our team at the Office of the Comptroller has been hard at work over the last year to begin an important revitalization in the agency. Guided by our agency-wide vision – to work in partnership to create a state that is more equitable, more resilient, and more prosperous so that every Marylander can reach their full potential – we set forth an ambitious agenda to modernize the agency and our infrastructure, obtain much-needed resources to better serve Marylanders throughout the state, and ensure Maryland is well-positioned for responsible long term economic growth and success.

The Comptroller’s Office released the agency’s inaugural State of the Economy Report in January, using economic data from 2023. My team led this collaborative effort to better understand the forces at play that have led the state to receive less revenue in the past year. Future reports will dive into specific areas uncovered by our findings. You can find all our research reports at marylandtaxes.gov/research to learn more.

As part of a much-needed modernization effort, we have launched Maryland Tax Connect, a self-service portal that now allows Maryland businesses to file their taxes online with increased ease and security, enabling taxpayers to interact with the Comptroller’s Office more efficiently. The portal is designed to allow taxpayers to complete essential functions and is accessible from a mobile device or a desktop. Our goal is for all Maryland taxpayers to be able to pay their state taxes and track their tax payments in this new system by 2026. For more information, visit marylandtaxes.gov/MDTaxConnect.

Additionally, during the 2025 tax season, eligible Marylanders will be able to file their state and federal taxes for free through the new Direct File program. Direct File is a new, simple, and secure tax filing software developed by the IRS in partnership with the Comptroller of Maryland, which will allow eligible taxpayers to prepare and file their tax returns online, directly with the government. Visit marylandtaxes.gov/directfile to learn more about this and other options available for Marylanders to file their taxes this year.

I am also pleased to report that we had another successful legislative session this past year. With broad stakeholder support, and in partnership with Governor Wes Moore, Senate President Bill Ferguson, and Speaker Adrienne Jones, we obtained additional resources for the Comptroller’s Office, including new positions to advance hiring efforts across the agency and $8.5 million for cybersecurity, training, audit efforts, equipment upgrades, maintenance, fraud, and accessibility-related projects, including translation services.

We also passed all six of our priority bills in our legislative package. Over the long term, these bills will help Marylanders by providing tax assistance funding for low-income residents of Maryland, supporting our agency’s compliance efforts, preventing and punishing tax preparer scams, promoting online filing, and providing resources to help raise awareness of personal income tax credits.

We look forward to working with you, your community, or your business. Only by building solid partnerships can we ensure the growth and thriving of our communities and businesses. Please call our team for assistance at 1-800-MD-TAXES or email us at taxhelp@marylandtaxes.gov.

Be well and please keep in touch!  
My best,

Brooke E. Lierman

   A: No. You may only claim one pension exclusion per individual based on age. See instructions 13 for details.

   *Note: Due to the State and local tax limitations (SALT), the state and local tax Line 17b of Form 502 is capped at $10,000 or $5,000 if married filing separately plus any amount deducted to claim the Preservation and Conservation Easements tax credit from part F of the 502CR.*

2. **Pension Exclusion Qualifying Plans.**

   Q: Do 401(k) and 403(b) plans qualify for the pension exclusion?

Free internet filing is available for Maryland income tax returns. Visit https://interactive.marylandtaxes.gov/Individuals/iFile_ChooseForm/

Software vendors should refer to the e-file handbook for their instructions.

SUBSTITUTE FORMS

You may file your Maryland income tax return on a computer-prepared or computer-generated substitute form provided the form is approved in advance by the Revenue Administration Division. The fact that a software package is available for retail purchase does not guarantee that the package or all forms have been approved for use.

To confirm that a software package or a specific form has been approved by the Comptroller or to see a list of Approved Software Vendors for Maryland Substitute Forms, visit marylandtaxes.gov and search Approved Vendors.

PENALTIES

There are severe penalties for failing to file a tax return, failing to pay any tax when due, filing a false or fraudulent return, or making a false certification. Penalties may include civil fines, criminal fines, imprisonment, and a penalty on your taxes. In addition, interest is charged on amounts not paid.

To collect unpaid taxes, the Comptroller is authorized to seize the salary, wages, or property of delinquent taxpayers.

1  WHO MUST FILE?

This booklet and forms are for residents and part-year residents of Maryland. In general, you must file a Maryland return if you are or were a resident of Maryland AND you are required to file a federal return. Information in this section will allow you to determine if you must file a return and pay taxes as a resident of Maryland. If you are not a resident but had Maryland tax withheld or had income from sources in Maryland, you must use Form 505 or 515, Nonresident Tax return.

WHO IS A RESIDENT?

You are a resident of Maryland if:  
a. Your permanent home is or was in Maryland (the law refers to this as your domicile). OR  
b. Your permanent home is outside of Maryland, but you maintained a place of abode (a place to live) in Maryland for more than six months of the tax year. If this applies to you and you were physically present in the state for 183 days or more, you must file a full-year resident return.

PART-YEAR RESIDENTS

If you began or ended residence in Maryland during the tax year, you must file a Maryland resident income tax return. See Instruction 26.

MILITARY AND OTHERS WORKING OUTSIDE OF MARYLAND

Military and other individuals whose domicile is in Maryland, but who are stationed or work outside of Maryland, including overseas, retain their Maryland legal residence. Maryland residency is not lost because of duty assignments outside of the State; see Administrative Release 37. Military personnel and their spouses should see Instruction 29.

TO DETERMINE IF YOU ARE REQUIRED TO FILE A MARYLAND RETURN

a. Add up all of your federal gross income to determine your total federal income. Gross income is defined in the Internal Revenue Code and, in general, consists of all income regardless of source.

IF YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FILE A MARYLAND RETURN BUT HAD MARYLAND TAXES WITHHELD OR YOU QUALIFY TO CLAIM A REFUNDABLE CREDIT

To claim a refund for Maryland income taxes withheld or to claim a refundable credit (see Instruction 21), you must file a Maryland return. Taxpayers who are filing for refund only, should complete all of the information at the top of Form 502 and the following Lines:

- 1-16
- 22*, 29*
- 35-44
- 46, 48

*Enter a zero unless: (i) you claim an earned income credit on your federal return, or (ii) you do not meet the minimum age requirement under the federal credit, but are otherwise eligible for the federal credit, for those without a qualifying child.

Attach applicable withholding statements (Forms W-2 and 1099), Form 502CR, and Maryland Schedule K-1 (510/511). The total amount withheld on all Forms W-2 and 1099 must equal the withholding you are claiming. Complete direct deposit information (Instruction 22) if desired and sign the return.

2 USE OF FEDERAL RETURN.

First complete your 2024 federal income tax return.

You will need information from your federal return to complete your Maryland return. Complete your federal return before you continue. Maryland law requires that your income and deductions be entered on your Maryland return exactly as they were reported on your federal return. If you use federal Form 1040NR, visit marylandtaxes.gov for further information. All items reported on your Maryland return are subject to verification, audit, and revision by the Maryland State Comptroller’s Office.

3 MARYLAND HEALTHCARE COVERAGE.

The Maryland General Assembly enacted Chapter 423 in the 2019 Session requiring the collection of certain information, including whether an individual is uninsured at the time the tax return is filed and whether the individual is interested in having Maryland Health Connection (“MHC”) determine whether an individual may be eligible for insurance affordability programs, such as no-cost or low-cost minimum essential health care coverage.

Check the appropriate box on Form 502 for you and/or your spouse if you are uninsured as of the date you file your return. If you would like MHC to determine pre-eligibility for health insurance affordability programs for any uninsured member of your household, you must also check the box on Form 502 indicating you authorize the Comptroller to share information from your tax return with MHC, which is operated by the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange.

For each dependent identified on Form 502B, check the appropriate box to indicate if that dependent is an uninsured individual as of the date the return is filed.

You must provide the date of birth for any uninsured individual who is interested in obtaining minimum essential health coverage.

If you authorize information sharing, we will share the following information with MHC:

- Name, SSN/ITIN, and date of birth of each individual identified on your return;
- Your current mailing address, email address, and phone number;
- Filing status reported on your return;
- Total number of individuals in your household included in your return;
- Insured/uninsured status of each individual included in your return;
- Blindness status;
- Relationship (self, spouse, or dependent) to the primary taxpayer for each individual included in your return; and
- Your federal adjusted gross income amount from Line 1.

Information shared with MHC will be used to determine eligibility for insurance affordability programs or to assist with enrollment in health coverage. If you would like more information about the health insurance affordability programs or health care coverage enrollment, visit Maryland Health Connection at marylandhealthconnection.gov/easyenrollment/.

4 NAME AND ADDRESS.

Print using blue or black ink.

Enter your name exactly as entered on your federal tax return. If you changed your name because of marriage, divorce, etc., be sure to report the change to the Social Security Administration before filing your return. This will prevent delays in the processing of your return.

Enter your current address using the spaces provided. On Current Mailing Address Line 1, enter the street number and street name of your current address. If using a PO Box address, enter “PO Box” and the PO Box number on Current Mailing Address Line 1. On Current Mailing Address Line 2, if applicable, enter the floor, suite or apartment number for your current mailing address. If using a PO Box address, leave Current Mailing Address Line 2 blank. Enter City or Town, State, and ZIP Code + 4.

If using a foreign address, complete the lines indicated for Country Name, Province/State/County, and Postal Code.

5  SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER(S) (SSN).

It is important that you enter each digit of your Social Security number in the space provided at the top of your tax return. Missing or unreadable digits will delay the processing of your return. Your name must match the name on your current Social Security card to ensure you receive your personal exemption. If your name does not match the name on your Social Security card, contact the federal Social Security Administration at 800-722-1213, or visit ssa.gov.

The Social Security number(s) must be a valid number issued by the Social Security Administration of the United States Government. If you, your spouse, or dependent(s) do not have a Social Security number and you are not eligible to get a SSN, you must apply for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) with the IRS and you should wait until you have received it before you file; and enter it wherever your Social Security number is requested on the return.

A missing or incorrect SSN or ITIN could result in the disallowance of any credits or exemptions you may be entitled to and result in a balance due.

A valid SSN or ITIN is required for any claim or exemption for a dependent. If you have a dependent who was placed with you for legal adoption and you do not know their SSN, you must get an Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number (ATIN) for the dependent from the IRS.

If your child was born and died in this tax year and you do not have a SSN for the child, complete just the name and relationship of the dependent and enter code 322, on one of the code number lines located to the right of the telephone number area on page 4 of the form; attach a copy of the child’s death certificate to your return.

## 6 MARYLAND POLITICAL SUBDIVISION INFORMATION (REQUIRED)

Fill in the lines for your Maryland physical address of the taxing area as of December 31, 2024, including political subdivision lines, based on your residence on the last day of the taxable period. Part-year residents fill in the lines for your Maryland physical address, including political subdivision lines, based on your last day of residence in Maryland in the taxable period. Military personnel who are legal residents of Maryland should fill in the lines for your Maryland physical address, including political subdivision lines, based on the Maryland physical address that is used for claiming Maryland as your Home of Record on file with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for tax year 2024.

1. Find your 4-Digit Political Subdivision Code in the LIST OF INCORPORATED CITIES, TOWNS, AND TAXING AREAS IN MARYLAND and enter this number on the 4 DIGIT POLITICAL SUBDIVISION CODE line.

   When selecting the 4 Digit Political Subdivision Code, be sure that you have selected the proper political subdivision from the LIST OF INCORPORATED CITIES, TOWNS AND TAXING AREAS IN MARYLAND. Do not rely on your ZIP Code + 4 to identify the proper political subdivision.

   For example, most residents within the ZIP Code of Upper Marlboro do not reside in the political subdivision of the Town of Upper Marlboro. Therefore, entering the Town of Upper Marlboro on the 4 DIGIT POLITICAL SUBDIVISION CODE line for those with a ZIP Code in Upper Marlboro may not be correct. Also, some political subdivisions have similar names such as Bel Air in Allegany County and Town of Bel Air in Harford County or Town of Chevy Chase and Town of Chevy Chase View. You may contact your county seat for further information relating to the incorporated boundaries of incorporated cities, towns, and taxing areas in your county.

### EXEMPTION AMOUNT CHART (10A)

The personal exemption is $3,200. This exemption is reduced once the taxpayer’s federal adjusted gross income exceeds $100,000 ($150,000 if filing Joint, Head of Household, or Qualifying Surviving Spouse with Dependent Child). This reduction applies to the additional dependency exemptions as well; however, it does not apply to the taxpayer’s age or blindness exemption of $1,000. Use the chart to determine the allowable exemption amount based upon the filing status. NOTE: For certain taxpayers with interest from U.S. obligations see Instruction 13, Line 13, code hh for applicable exemption adjustment.

| Married couples who filed joint federal returns but were domiciled in different counties, cities, towns or taxing areas on the last day of the year | Joint return Filing Status 2 or Married filing separately Filing Status 3 | If you are filing separately, see Instruction 8. If you are filing a joint return see SPECIAL NOTE in Instruction 19. |
| Married couples who filed joint federal returns but were domiciled in different states on the last day of the year |  | If you are filing separately, see Instruction 8. If you are filing a joint return, you must attach a pro forma Form 505 and 505NR. See Technical Bulletin 1 & Administrative Release 3. |
| All other married couples who filed joint federal returns | Joint return Filing Status 2 | If your spouse does not have and is not required to have a Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number enter “999-00-9999” in the space for your spouse’s Social Security number (for the purpose of this form ONLY). |

If you itemized your deductions on the joint federal return, one spouse may use the standard deduction and the other spouse may claim those deductions on the federal return that are “attributable exclusively” to that spouse, plus a prorated amount of the remaining deductions. If it is not possible to determine these deductions, the deduction must be allocated proportionately based on your share of the income.

“Attributable exclusively” means that the individual is solely responsible for the payment of an expense claimed as an itemized deduction, including compliance with a valid court order or separation agreement; or the individual jointly responsible for the payment of an expense claimed as an itemized deduction can demonstrate payment of the full amount of the deduction with funds that are not attributable in whole or in part, to the other jointly responsible individual.

If both spouses choose to itemize on their separate Maryland returns, then each spouse must determine which deductions are attributable exclusively to each spouse and prorate the remaining deductions using the Maryland Income Factor. See Instruction 26k. If it is not possible to determine deductions in this manner, they must be allocated proportionately based on their respective shares of the income. The total amount of itemized deductions for both spouses cannot exceed the itemized deductions on the federal return.

If you choose to use the standard deduction method, use STANDARD DEDUCTION WORKSHEET (16A) in Instruction 16. Each spouse must claim their own personal exemption. Each spouse may allocate the dependent exemptions in any manner they choose. A dependent may not be claimed twice. The total number of dependents claimed may not exceed the overall number of dependents. Complete the remainder of the form using the instructions for each line. Each spouse should claim their own withholding and other credits. Joint estimated tax paid may be divided between the spouses in any manner provided the total claimed does not exceed the total estimated tax paid.

## 13 SUBTRACTIONS FROM INCOME.

Determine which subtractions from income apply to you.
Write the correct amounts on Lines 8 through 14 of Form
502. Instructions for each line:

### Line 8. STATE TAX REFUNDS.

Copy onto Line 8 the amount of refunds of state or local income tax included in Line 1 of Form 502.

### Line 9. CHILD AND DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSES.

You may subtract the cost of caring for your dependents while you work. There is a limitation of $3,000 ($6,000 if two or more dependents receive care). Enter on Line 9 the smaller of (a) the amount on Line 6 of federal Form 2441 or (b) $3,000 ($6,000 if two or more dependents receive care). You may also be entitled to credits for these taxable expenses. See instructions for Part B and Part CC of Form 502CR.

### Line 10a. PENSION EXCLUSION.

You may be able to subtract some of your taxable pension and retirement annuity income. This subtraction applies only if:

a. You were 65 or over or totally disabled, or your spouse was totally disabled, on the last day of the tax year, AND

b. You included on your federal return taxable income received as a pension, annuity, or endowment from an “employee retirement system” qualified under Sections 401(a), 403 or 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. [A traditional IRA, a Roth IRA, a rollover IRA, a simplified employee plan (SEP), a Keogh plan, an ineligible deferred compensation plan or foreign retirement income does not qualify.]

> **Note:** For additional information regarding qualified plans pension exclusion, refer to FAQs #2 on page iii Resident Booklet; and Form 502R Instructions; and the chart of Form 502R.

Each spouse who receives taxable pension or annuity income and is 65 or over or totally disabled may be entitled to this exclusion. In addition, if you receive taxable pension or annuity income but you are not 65 or totally disabled, you may be entitled to this exclusion if your spouse is totally disabled. Complete a separate column in the PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTATION WORKSHEET (13A) for each spouse. Combine your allowable exclusion and enter the total amount on Line 10a, Form 502. On Line 10a, Form 502 check the applicable box(es) for yourself and/or spouse.

To be considered totally disabled, you must have a mental or physical impairment which prevents you from engaging in substantial gainful activity. You must expect the impairment to be of long, continued, or indefinite duration or to result in your death. You must attach to your return a certification from a qualified physician stating the nature of your impairment and that you are totally disabled. If you have previously submitted a physician’s certification, attach your own statement that you are still totally disabled and that a physician’s certification was submitted before.

If you are a part-year resident, complete PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTATION WORKSHEET (13A) using total taxable pension and total Social Security and railroad retirement benefits as if you were a full-year resident. Prorate the amount on Line 5 by the number of months of Maryland residence divided by 12. However, if you began to receive your pension during the tax year you became a Maryland resident, use a proration factor of the number of months you were a resident divided by the number of months the pension was received.

For example, Pat Taxpayer moved to Maryland on March 1. If he started to receive his pension on March 1, he would prorate the pension exclusion by 10/10, which would mean he would be entitled to the full pension exclusion. However, if he began to receive his pension on February 1, Pat would prorate his pension by 10/11. Note that, in any case, the proration factor may not exceed 1.

Complete the PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTATION WORKSHEET (13A). Copy the amount from Line 5 of the worksheet onto Line 10a, Form 502. On Line 10a, Form 502 check the applicable box(es) for yourself and/or spouse.

> **Note:** You must complete and attach Form 502R to Form 502 if you or your spouse are claiming a pension exclusion on Line 10a of Form 502. See Form 502R for additional information.

### Line 10b. PENSION EXCLUSION FOR RETIRED FOREST/PARK/WILDLIFE RANGER.

An individual taxpayer may not claim BOTH the standard Pension Exclusion and the Pension Exclusion for Retired Forest/Park/Wildlife Ranger. If you are 65 or older on the last day of the calendar year, you are totally disabled, or your spouse is totally disabled, and you have received qualified pension income, you should complete the PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTATION WORKSHEET (13A) regardless of your prior work history. It is permissible for one spouse to claim the standard Pension Exclusion and the other spouse to claim the Pension Exclusion for Retired Forest/Park/Wildlife Ranger, if each spouse meets the applicable required criteria.

If you meet the following criteria, use the RETIRED FOREST/PARK/WILDLIFE RANGER PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTATION WORKSHEET (13E) to calculate your eligible pension exclusion:

a. You were 55 or over on the last day of the tax year, AND  
b. You were not 65 or older, or totally disabled, or have a spouse who is totally disabled, AND  
c. You included on your federal return taxable income received as a pension, annuity, or endowment from an “employee retirement system” qualified under Section 401(a), 403 or 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA, a rollover IRA, a simplified employee plan (SEP), a Keogh plan, an ineligible deferred compensation plan for foreign retirement income does not qualify.), AND  
d. The retirement income is attributable to your service as a Forest/Park/Wildlife Ranger of the United States, the State of Maryland or a political subdivision of Maryland.

Each spouse who meets the above requirements may be entitled to the exclusion. If each spouse is eligible, complete a separate column on the RETIRED FOREST/PARK/WILDLIFE RANGER PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTATION WORKSHEET (13E). Combine your allowable exclusions from Line 8 of the worksheet and enter the total amount on Line 10b, Form 502. On Line 10b, Form 502 check the applicable box(es) for yourself and/or spouse.

If you are a part-year resident, complete the RETIRED FOREST/PARK/WILDLIFE RANGER PENSION EXCLUSION COMPUTATION WORKSHEET (13E) using total taxable pension and total Social Security and railroad retirement benefits as if you were a full-year resident. Prorate the amount on Line 8 by the number of months of Maryland residence divided by 12. However, if you began to receive your pension during the tax year you became a Maryland resident, use a proration factor of the number of months you were a resident divided by the number of months the pension was received. Copy the prorated amount from Line 8 of the worksheet onto Line 10b, Form 502.

For example, Pat Taxpayer moved to Maryland on March 1. If he started to receive his pension on March 1, he would prorate the pension exclusion by 10/10, which would mean he would be entitled to the full pension exclusion. However, if he began to receive his pension on February 1, Pat would prorate his pension by 10/11. In any case, the prorated factor may not exceed 1.

> **Note:** You must complete and attach Form 502R to the Form 502 if you and/or your spouse are claiming a pension exclusion on Line 10b of Form 502. See the Form 502R for additional information.

### Line 12. NONRESIDENT INCOME.

If you began or ended your residence in Maryland during the year, you may subtract the portion of your income received when you were not a resident of Maryland. See Instruction 26 for part-year residents and Technical Bulletin 1 for military personnel.

If your state of residence or your period of Maryland residence was not the same as that of your spouse and you filed a joint return, follow Instruction 26 (c) through (p).

### Line 22. EARNED INCOME CREDIT

If you claimed an earned income credit on your federal return or would otherwise have been eligible to claim an earned income credit on your federal return but for you or your spouse filing with an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), you are eligible for the Maryland earned income credit. If you are a married couple filing either a joint or separate Maryland return, or you have at least one qualifying child, then you may claim one-half (50%) of the federal credit on your Maryland return. Individuals filing as single, head of household, or qualifying surviving spouse without a qualifying child may claim 100% of the federal earned income credit, see Worksheet (18A.1) to calculate any refundable earned income tax credit. If you are a part-year resident or a member of the military, see Instruction 26(o) before completing this worksheet.

If you do not meet the minimum age requirement under the federal credit and are otherwise eligible for the federal credit for those without a qualifying child, you may claim the state earned income credit (calculate federal earned income credit disregarding the minimum age requirement). If you or your spouse do not possess a valid SSN but are otherwise eligible for the federal credit and are filing your Maryland return using an ITIN, you may claim the state earned income credit by calculating the federal earned income credit disregarding the SSN requirement. If you filed a joint federal return but a separate Maryland return, you may claim a combined total of up to one-half the federal credit. For information on how to calculate the amount of the federal earned income credit, visit irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p596.pdf.

---

## 22 OVERPAYMENT OR BALANCE DUE.

Calculate the Balance Due (Line 45 of Form 502) or Overpayment (Line 46 of Form 502). Read instructions under UNDERPAYMENT OF ESTIMATED TAX and then go to BALANCE DUE or OVERPAYMENT. The length of time you have for claiming a refund is limited. See Instruction 28 for more information.

### UNDERPAYMENT OF ESTIMATED TAX

If you had income from which tax was not withheld or did not have enough tax withheld during the year, you may have owed an estimated tax. All taxpayers should refer to Form 502UP to determine if they owe interest because they underpaid estimated tax during the year.

If you owe interest, complete Form 502UP, write the amount of interest (line 18 of Form 502UP) and check the box on Line 49 of Form 502. Attach Form 502UP.

Generally, you do not owe interest if:

a. you owe less than $500 tax on income that is not subject to Maryland withholding;  
b. each current year payment, made quarterly as required, is equal to or more than one-fourth of 110% of last year’s tax, that was developed; OR  
c. you made quarterly payments during the year that equal 90% of this year’s tax.  
d. If 90% of your taxable income was taxable to another state or your income was received unevenly, see Instruction 23 for more information.

Special rules apply if your gross income from farming or fishing is at least two-thirds of your total estimated gross income. See Form 502UP for additional information and instructions for claiming this exemption from interest.

### INTEREST FOR LATE FILING

Interest is due at the rate of 11.4825% annually or 0.9568% per month for any month or part of a month that a tax is paid after the original due date of the 2024 return but before January 1, 2026. For assistance in calculating interest for tax paid on or after January 1, 2026, visit marylandtaxes.gov. Enter any interest due on the appropriate line of your tax return.

- Penalty up to 10% may be assessed by the Comptroller of Maryland for failing to pay any tax, or failing to file a tax return, when due.

### TOTAL INTEREST AND PENALTY

Enter the total of interest for underpayment of estimated tax, interest for late filing, and penalty for withdrawal of funds from a First Time Homebuyer Savings Account for an ineligible purpose on Line 49 of Form 502.

- Enter 10% of the amount of any addition modification attributed to code letter “s”, First Time Homebuyer Savings Account addition, for funds withdrawn for an ineligible purpose.

Note: Funds withdrawn from the account and deposited into a new First Time Homebuyer Savings Account or a disbursement of assets of a First Time Homebuyer Savings Account under an account holder’s bankruptcy filing are not subject to the penalty.

### BALANCE DUE

If you have a balance due, add this amount to any amount on Line 49. Enter the total on Line 50. Pay your balance due (unless it is less than $1.00). See Instructions 23 and 24 regarding signatures, attachments, and mailing.

### OVERPAYMENT

If you file Form 502 and have an overpayment on Line 46, the Revenue Administration Division will refund any amount of $1.00 or more. If you want part or all of your overpayment applied to your 2025 estimated tax, then write the amount you want applied on Line 47. Overpayments may first be applied to previous years’ tax liabilities or other debts as required by federal or state law. If you must pay interest for underpayment of estimated tax, enter the amount of interest from Line 18 of Form 502UP on Line 49. Subtract Lines 47 and 49 from your overpayment (Line 46). This is the amount of your refund. Write this amount on Line 48. No refunds of less than $1.00 will be sent. If the amount on Line 49 is more than the overpayment on Line 46 of Form 502, enter zero (0) on Lines 47 and 48. Then subtract Line 46 from Line 49 and enter the result on Line 50. If you prefer, you may leave Line 49 blank and the Revenue Administration Division will calculate the interest charges and send you a bill. See Instructions 23 and 24 regarding signatures, attachments, and mailing.

### DIRECT DEPOSIT OF REFUND

To comply with banking and National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) rules, we ask you to indicate by checking the appropriate box on your return if the state refund is going to an account outside the United States. If you indicate that this is the case, STOP! Do not enter your routing and account numbers, as the direct deposit option is not available to you. We will send you a paper check.

By choosing direct deposit of your refund and checking the appropriate box, you authorize the State of Maryland to disclose to your bank, to the State’s depository bank and their financial partners, and NACHA any tax return information necessary to make the deposit, such as your refund amount, your name, and the name(s) as it appears on the bank account. Complete Lines 51a, b, c, and d of Form 502 if you want us to deposit your refund directly into your account at a bank or other financial institution (such as a mutual fund, brokerage firm, or credit union) in the United States.

Check with your financial institution to make sure your direct deposit will be accepted and to get the correct routing and account numbers. If you enter the incorrect account or omit any required information, the State of Maryland will not be responsible for recovering that refund and/or for making the direct deposit payment electronically.

#### Line 51a.

Check the appropriate box to identify the type of account that will be used (checking or savings). You must check one box only or a refund check will be mailed.

#### Line 51b.

The routing number must be nine digits. If the first two digits are not 01 through 12 or 21 through 32, the direct deposit will be rejected and a check will be mailed.

If you are not sure of the correct routing number or if your check states that it is payable through a financial institution different from the one at which you have your checking account, contact your financial institution for the correct routing number.

#### Line 51c.

The account number can be up to 17 characters (both numbers and letters). Omit spaces, hyphens, and special symbols. Enter the number from left to right. If we are notified by the financial institution that the direct deposit is not successful, a refund check will be mailed to you. Have a bank statement for the deposit account available if you contact us concerning the direct deposit of your refund.

#### Line 51d.

Indicate the name(s) as it appears on the bank account.

**DISCLOSURE** By requesting a direct deposit of your Maryland tax refund and entering your bank account number, routing number, account type, and name(s) as it appears on your bank account and on your income tax return, you authorize the Comptroller’s Office to disclose this information regarding your refund amount to the Maryland State Treasurer’s Office (who performs banking services for the Comptroller’s Office).

24 ELECTRONIC FILING, MAILING AND PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS, DEADLINES AND EXTENSION.

#### ELECTRONICALLY FILING YOUR RETURN

The fastest way to file your return, and receive your refund is to file electronically and request direct deposit. If you request direct deposit on your electronic return, your refund should be in your bank account within 72 hours of acknowledgment from the Revenue Administration Division. You may request electronic funds withdrawal (direct debit) payments on your electronic return. If you both file and pay electronically, your return is due April 15th. If any due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the return must be filed by the next business day. However, you will have until April 30th to make your electronic payment. Note: An online payment where the bank mails the Comptroller of Maryland a paper check is not considered an electronic payment. You may file your return electronically through your personal computer. Do not send a paper copy of the return if you electronically filed. For more information, visit marylandtaxes.gov.

#### ELECTRONIC PAYMENT OF BALANCE DUE

If your paper or electronic tax return has a balance due, you may pay electronically at marylandtaxes.gov by selecting Bill Pay. The amount that you designate will be debited from your bank or financial institution on the date that you choose.

#### PAYMENT BY CHECK OR MONEY ORDER

Make your check or money order payable to “Comptroller of Maryland.” You must use blue or black ink. Do not use red ink or pencil. Write the type of tax and year of tax being paid on your check. You must include the Social Security number/ Individual Taxpayer Identification Number of the taxpayer if filing individually; if filing jointly, you must include the Social Security number/ Individual Taxpayer Identification Number if the primary taxpayer on the check.

Your check or money order should be attached to the completed Form PV. Do not attach the check or money order to your return.

#### ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODS

For alternative methods of payment, such as a credit card, visit marylandtaxes.gov.

Note: We can only honor your request on an electronically-filed return or through your registered request on our website.

```

Sending your return by certified mail will not result in special handling and may delay your refund.

```

#### DUE DATE

Returns must be mailed by April 15th, 2025, for calendar year taxpayers. If any due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the return must be filed by the next business day. If filing on a fiscal year basis, see Instruction 25.

#### EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE

Follow the instructions on Form PV found on the PAYMENT VOUCHER WORKSHEET FOR ESTIMATED TAX AND EXTENSION PAYMENTS (PVW) to request an automatic extension of the time to file your 2024 return.

If any due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the return must be filed by the next business day. You can file and pay by credit card or electronic funds withdrawal (direct debit) on our website.

If no tax is due and you did not request a federal extension, file your extension online at marylandtaxes.gov or by phone at 410-260-7829. Only submit Form PV if tax is due.

##### COMBAT ZONE EXTENSION

PAYMENT VOUCHER  WORKSHEET  FOR ESTIMATED TAX  
AND EXTENSION PAYMENTS  (PVW)  

## ESTIMATED TAX WORKSHEET INSTRUCTIONS

**If Filing Status 2, 4, 5:**  
If the amount computed is less than $3,650, enter $3,650; if the amount is between $3,650 and $5,450, enter that amount; if the amount is more than $5,450, enter $5,450.

### Purpose of declaration

The filing of a declaration of estimated Maryland income tax is a part of the pay-as-you-go plan of income tax collection adopted by the State. If you have any income such as pensions, business income, lottery, capital gains, interest, dividends, etc., from which no tax is withheld, or wages from which not enough Maryland tax is withheld, you may have to pay estimated taxes. The law is similar to the federal law.

### Who must file a declaration

You must file a declaration of estimated tax if you are required to file a Maryland income tax return and your gross income would be expected to develop a tax of more than $500 in excess of your Maryland withholding.

You must file a declaration with payment in full within 60 days of receiving $500 or more of income from awards, prizes, lotteries or raffles, whether paid in cash or property if Maryland tax has not been withheld. A married couple may file a joint declaration. If you are filing a joint declaration, both Social Security numbers must be entered. If filing on behalf of a minor, the name and Social Security number of the minor must be entered.

### When to file a declaration

You must pay at least one-fourth of the total estimated tax on Line 15 of this form on or before April 15, 2025. The remaining quarterly payments are due June 15, 2025, September 15, 2025 and January 15, 2026. You may pay the total estimated tax with your first payment. If you are filing on a fiscal year basis, each payment is due by the 15th day of the 4th, 6th, 9th and 13th months following the beginning of the fiscal year.

### Overpayment of tax

If you overpaid your 2024 income tax (Form 502 or 505), you may apply all or part of the overpayment to your 2025 estimated tax. If the overpayment applied equals or exceeds the estimated tax liability for the first quarterly payment, you are not required to file the declaration. If the overpayment applied is less than the estimated tax liability, you should file the declaration and pay the balance of the first installment.

### How to estimate your 2025 tax

The worksheet is designed to develop an estimate of your 2025 Maryland and local income tax. Be as accurate as you can in forecasting your 2025 income. You may use your 2024 income tax as a guide, but if you will receive more income than you did in 2024, you must pay at least 110% of your prior year tax to avoid interest for underpayment of estimated tax. For the purpose of estimating, rounding all amounts to the nearest dollar is recommended.

Nonresidents who want to estimate 2025 Maryland taxes may use the Nonresident Estimate Tax Calculator at marylandtaxes.gov.

### Specific Instructions

**Line 1. Total income expected in 2025** is your estimated federal adjusted gross income.

**Line 2. Net modifications.** You must add certain items to your federal adjusted gross income. See Instruction 12 of the tax instructions. You may subtract certain items from federal adjusted gross income. See Instruction 13 of the tax instructions. Enter on this line the net result of additions and subtractions.

**Line 4. Deductions.** You may compute your tax using the standard deduction method or the itemized deduction method.

#### Standard deduction

Compute 15% of Line 3.

- **If Filing Status 1, 3, 6:** If the amount computed is less than $1,800, enter $1,800; if the amount is between $1,800 and $2,700, enter that amount; if the amount is more than $2,700, enter $2,700.
- **If Filing Status 2, 4, 5:** If the amount computed is less than $3,650, enter $3,650; if the amount is between $3,650 and $5,450, enter that amount; if the amount is more than $5,450, enter $5,450.

#### Itemized deductions

Enter the total of federal itemized deductions less state and local income taxes.

**Line 6. Personal exemptions.**  
If your FAGI will be $100,000 or less, you are allowed:  
a. $3,200 each for taxpayer and spouse.  
b. $1,000 each for taxpayer and spouse if age 65 or over and/or blind.  
c. $3,200 for each allowable dependent, other than taxpayer and spouse. The amount is doubled for allowable dependents age 65 or over.

#### Farmers and fishermen

If your estimated gross income from farming or fishing is at least two-thirds of your total estimated gross income for the year, special provisions may apply. Your 2025 declaration and full payment of the estimated tax are due on or before January 15, 2026. You do not have to file the declaration if you file your complete tax return (Form 502 or 505) and pay the full amount of tax due on or before March 1, 2026.

#### Filing a return instead of fourth payment

Instead of making the fourth declaration payment on or before January 15, 2026, you may file and pay the balance of tax due on or before January 31, 2026.

#### Changes in income or exemptions

Your situation may not require you to file a declaration on April 15, 2025. However, a large increase in income after that date may require you to file a declaration. If at any time during the year you need to amend your original declaration, simply increase or decrease the remaining payments.

#### Forms and information

Can be found by visiting marylandtaxes.gov, at any of the Comptroller of Maryland branch offices, or calling 410-260-7980 from Central Maryland or 1-800-MD-TAXES from elsewhere.

### Will penalties and interest be owed?

You will owe interest on tax not paid by the regular due date of your return. The interest will accrue until you pay the tax. Even if you had a good reason for not paying on time, you will still owe interest.

If tax and interest are not paid promptly, a penalty will be assessed on the tax.

### When should I include a copy of Form PV if I am requesting an extension of time to file?

Only include Form PV with Form 502, 505, or 515 if you are filing an extension request along with a payment by check or money order. If you are making an extension payment electronically, you do not need to include Form PV. Do not include Form PV to request an extension if you are not making an extension payment.

---

### EXTENSION WORKSHEET INSTRUCTIONS

#### Who must file for an extension?

If you cannot complete and file your Form 502, 505, 510C or 515 by the due date, you should complete the Tax Payment Worksheet to determine if you must file for an extension. If Line 6 of the worksheet shows you owe tax, you must file Form PV and pay the full amount due by April 15, 2025, (or the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of the tax year). If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the return must be filed by the next business day.

**NOTE:** Filing an extension does not extend the time for paying your taxes.

Do not file for an extension if, after completing the PVW, you find that you do not owe additional tax. However, be aware that if an unpaid liability is disclosed when you file your return, you may owe penalty and interest charges in addition to the tax. See “Will penalties and interest be owed?”.

#### Automatic Maryland six-month extension

If you filed a federal extension and expect to owe zero tax to Maryland we grant you an automatic six-month extension of time to file your Form 502, 505, 510C, or 515. You are not required to file for an extension in order to obtain this automatic extension. However, you should use Form PV to pay any tax due of forms 502, 505, and 515, but you should use Form EL102B to pay any tax due or payment with extension of Form 510C in order to avoid any late-payment penalty and interest on tax not paid by April 15, 2025.

**Note:** In the case of Form 510C, the PVW must be completed to estimate the payment.

#### Requesting a Maryland extension when not requesting a federal extension:

1. Request your extension by telefile at 410-260-7829 from Central Maryland or 1-800-260-3664 from elsewhere; or,
2. Request your extension at [marylandtaxes.gov](https://marylandtaxes.gov).

#### When should Form PV be mailed without a payment?

Never.

#### When requesting an extension beyond six months:

No extension request will be granted for more than six months, except in the case of individuals who are out of the United States. Even when an individual is out of the U.S. an extension will not be granted for more than one year. An extension request for beyond six months without a payment should be filed by telefile or on our website. For more information, visit [marylandtaxes.gov](https://marylandtaxes.gov).

## HOW TO MAXIMIZE YOUR  
Maryland College Investment Plan Tax Benefits

### Did you know that Maryland taxpayers may be eligible for a STATE INCOME SUBTRACTION if they open a new OR contribute to an existing Maryland College Investment Plan account?

#### 1. Parent 1 opens a Maryland College Investment Plan account for a single beneficiary and Parent 2 makes an additional contribution to the account.

### ELIGIBILITY

Each family member who opens a new account or contributes to an existing account may be eligible for the income subtraction.

|                | PARENT 1 Account Owner | PARENT 2 Account Contributor |
|----------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| CONTRIBUTIONS  | $2,500                | $2,500                       |
| Estimated Tax Saving* | $190           | $190                         |

Maryland taxpayers can receive a maximum $2,500 subtraction from their State adjusted gross income annually per beneficiary for contributions to the Investment Plan. To take advantage of this Maryland income subtraction for a particular year, you must make your contribution by **DECEMBER 31** of that year.

### SUBTRACTIONS

Subtract up to $2,500 per year for each beneficiary in a College Investment Plan. Subtractions apply to Maryland taxable income for the parent’s contributions in that tax year.

|                | Amount   |
|----------------|----------|
| TOTAL STATE AND LOCAL TAX SAVINGS on $5,000 subtraction | $380 |
| COMBINED ANNUAL INCOME SUBTRACTION** | $5,000 |

---

*Note that this is a hypothetical scenario assuming a 7.6% State and local tax rate with no federal deduction. The amount of savings from your State income subtraction may vary.  
**Account owners and contributors can each subtract contributions regardless of their marital status or tax filing status (individual or joint). A contributor need not be a parent or family member of the beneficiary to be eligible for the income subtraction.

The Maryland Senator Edward J. Kasemeyer College Investment Plan Disclosure Statement provides investment objectives, risks, expenses and costs, fees, and other information you should read and consider carefully before investing. If you or your beneficiary live outside of Maryland, you should compare Maryland 529 to any college savings program offered by your home state or your beneficiary’s home state, which may offer state tax or other state benefits such as financial aid, scholarship funds, and protection from creditors that are only available for investments in such state’s 529 plan. Tax benefits may be conditioned on meeting certain requirements, such as residency, purpose for or timing of distributions, or other factors, as applicable. If you receive a State contribution for any account in a given year, you are not eligible in that year for the income subtraction on your State taxes for contributions that you made to that or any other College Investment Plan account. You should consult with a tax or legal professional for additional information. T. Rowe Price Investment Services, Inc., Distributor/Underwriter of the Maryland Senator Edward J. Kasemeyer College Investment Plan.

STATE DEPARTMENT OF ASSESSMENTS AND TAXATION

INFORMATION REGARDING PROPERTY TAX CREDITS AND EXEMPTIONS

Under Maryland law, you may be eligible for a substantial credit on the property tax bill issued on your home, based upon your gross household income. This program is available to homeowners of all ages and the credit is calculated solely on the basis of gross income. The application form is not provided in this income tax booklet because the credits are issued as a deduction from the homeowner’s July property tax bill. The property tax credit application forms are processed separately by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation.  
Use the chart printed below to see if it would be worthwhile for you to submit a Homeowners’ Tax Credit application. If the actual property taxes on your home (based on no more than $300,000 of assessed value) exceed the “Tax Limit” amount shown on the table below for your household income level, you may be eligible for a credit and are urged to file an application. The table is printed for illustrative purposes, and therefore, the income amounts are listed in increments of $1,000. For purposes of this program, the applicant must report total income, which means the combined gross household income before any deductions are taken. Nontaxable income, such as Social Security, Railroad Retirement, or Veterans’ benefits, also must be reported as income for the tax credit program.

#### 2024 COMBINED GROSS HOUSEHOLD INCOME

| BEFORE DEDUCTIONS | TAX LIMIT | BEFORE DEDUCTIONS | TAX LIMIT | BEFORE DEDUCTIONS | TAX LIMIT |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| $0 - $8,000       | $0        | 17,000            | 510       | 26,000            | 1,320     |
| 9,000             | 40        | 18,000            | 600       | 27,000            | 1,410     |
| 10,000            | 80        | 19,000            | 690       | 28,000            | 1,500     |

| 16,000            | 420       | 25,000            | 1,230     |                   |           |

* For each additional $1,000 of Income add $90 to $1,680 to find the amount that your tax must exceed.

If you think you might qualify on the basis of your household income, there are certain other legal requirements which you must meet. Due to space restrictions, all of the other special limitations cannot be listed in this notice. The purpose of this notice is simply to advise you of the availability of the program and to suggest that you inquire further if you think you qualify on the basis of the income chart provided above.
